# Server acceptance: prerequisites, preflight, deployment rehearsal, evidence.
#
# Run this ON the server, from the repository root:
#
#   deploy/server-acceptance.sh                    # checks and preflight only
#   deploy/server-acceptance.sh --rehearse         # full rehearsal, no bootstrap secrets
#   deploy/server-acceptance.sh --bootstrap-file /path/to/operator.json
#   deploy/server-acceptance.sh --rehearse --skip-install
#   sudo deploy/server-acceptance.sh --rehearse --install-unit --bootstrap-file /path/operator.json
#   sudo deploy/server-acceptance.sh --rehearse --install-unit --first-project --bootstrap-file /path/operator.json
#
# The supervised installation runs as an account that exists on the server and
# holds the checkout. Name it when it is not 'sbarbase', the shipped default:
#
#   deploy/server-acceptance.sh --rehearse --install-unit \
#        --service-user ops-account --home /srv/ops-account --bun-dir /srv/ops-account/.bun/bin
#
# Every step uses the declared local socket and data root. For nondefault paths,
# provide SBARBASE_DOCKER_SOCKET and SBARBASE_DOCKER_DATA_ROOT to both this run
# and the service drop-in. Any DOCKER_HOST must match the declared socket.
#
#   deploy/server-acceptance.sh --rehearse --docker-host unix:///var/run/docker.sock
#
# Every start of the unit is recorded only once its console answers over
# loopback; --console-timeout SECONDS bounds that wait (default 300).
#
# It never prints a secret: only whether a bootstrap file was used. Every step
# that fails stops the run and exits non-zero. Evidence lands in
# docs/evidence/deployment-rehearsal.json and is copied to
# docs/evidence/server-acceptance-latest.json for handoff.
