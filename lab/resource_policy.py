"""Resource tier table for the sbarbase installation.

Design source: docs/engineering/RESOURCE-POLICY.md section 3.1 ("One table, one module"),
read at commit 46d8d46 on 2026-09-21. Every value below is copied from that
table. The table is a policy, not a measurement: section 3.1 says the numbers
must be measured before they are trusted, and section 7 step 8 is the run that
would do it. Nothing here has been calibrated.

Two values the design left open, and the smallest honest choice made here:

- The design gives the maintenance class "cpus: unchanged from today" and
  "memory: unchanged from today". Those two are represented as None, which means
  this table does not override the memory and CPU values the target runtime
  already launches with. Inventing a number here would have been a preference,
  not a policy.
- The design gives maintenance "pids 128 / 64" for containers and export
  helpers. Only the container figure (128) is in the table; the repository's
  durable runtime does not launch a maintenance export helper, so a second row
  would be an unused invention. It is an open item, not a silent omission.

The Docker mapping this table assumes has been measured, and the measurement
corrects it. docs/engineering/RESOURCE-POLICY.md section 3.1.1 records the reading taken
2026-09-21, raw values in docs/evidence/resource-policy-cgroup-mapping.json:
--cpu-shares maps to the cgroup v2 cpu.weight sublinearly, so 2048 asks for
weight 174 and not 800, which makes the shares column below a request and a
relative order rather than a weight this table can promise; and --blkio-weight
does not bind at all on this host, where every request left io.weight at its
default, so the weight column isolates nothing and no claim of block IO
separation may rest on it. The memory and pids columns were observed to bind.
The flags stay as they are: they are inherited from the design's table, and
section 3.1.1 is where their effect is stated.

The class label is what a container carries in the Docker label
io.sbarbase.tier. Class names are exactly the five in the design: system,
production, experimental, operator, maintenance. A row id, not a class name, is
what a launch site passes here, because the design gives the system class three
different memory and CPU rows.

No per-environment class field exists in the runtime state yet, so an
environment's Auth and REST launch under the production row, which is the
worked example in section 3.2. Making the class configurable, and therefore
using the experimental row, is an open item.
